      <p class="mb-4">
        The camera obscura, meaning "dark chamber" in Latin, was the foundation of photographic technology. Initially, it was a room-sized device used by artists and scientists to study optics and create accurate drawings. The basic principle involved light passing through a small hole into a darkened room, projecting an inverted image of the outside scene.
