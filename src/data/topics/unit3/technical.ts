  title: "Technical Aspects of Photography",
  content: `Technical mastery in photography requires understanding several fundamental concepts that control image creation. These elements work together to produce properly exposed, well-composed photographs.

Depth of Field (DOF):
- Controlled primarily by aperture setting
- Affected by focal length and subject distance
- Creates selective focus effects
- Helps isolate subjects or maintain overall sharpness

Aperture and Shutter Speed:
Aperture (f-stops):
- Controls amount of light entering camera
- Affects depth of field
- Common range: f/1.4 to f/22
- Larger numbers = smaller openings

Shutter Speed:
- Controls duration of exposure
- Affects motion blur/freezing
- Typical range: 1/8000s to several seconds
- Must consider camera shake threshold

Lenses and Functions:
Types of Lenses:
- Wide-angle (below 35mm)
- Standard (35-70mm)
- Telephoto (above 70mm)
- Macro for close-up work
- Specialty lenses (tilt-shift, fisheye)

Lens Characteristics:
- Focal length
- Maximum aperture
- Image stabilization
- Focus mechanisms
- Distortion characteristics

Composition Techniques:
- Rule of thirds
- Leading lines
- Symmetry and patterns
- Framing
- Perspective control
- Balance and visual weight

Camera Angles and Movements:
Angles:
- Eye level
- High angle
- Low angle
- Bird's eye
- Worm's eye

Movements:
- Pan
- Tilt
- Dolly
- Truck
- Pedestal

Subject-Camera Relationship:
- Distance affects perspective
- Angle affects subject portrayal
- Movement creates dynamic elements
- Position influences story-telling

These technical aspects form the foundation of photographic control and creative expression. Understanding their interrelationships allows photographers to make informed decisions for achieving desired results.`,
